Selectors

Element : We can use html element name to define css rules
Class : We can define our own class names in which we can apply css
Universal: Rarely being used, this will apply the style defined to all HTML elements.
ID: Same CSS rules but it applies on one specific element.
Atributes: Applies styes to all elements with the Atribute.

We can assign multiple classes with a space between classes.

CSS Specificity:

1st priority: Inline styles
2nd priority: CSS class (user-defined) attribute.
3rd priority: Based on top-bottom parse.

Cascading: Multiple rules apply to same element.
Specificity: Resolves conflict arising from multiple rules.
<Tag> and ::pseudo element Selectors have lowest priority.
* has lowest priority
.class, :pseudo-class and [attribute] Selectors have higher priority than <Tag> Selectors.
#ID: more higher priority
Inline: highest priority.

Inheritance: Usually defined in body, some CSS rules which gets applied to HTML 
elements whenever we define those. Of course, if we add any high priority Selectors like
class, id, then definitely it will override that particular style defined in body.
